    <h2> Objective </h2>
    <p> Being a Computer Science major, I still want to make a difference to the world problems.<br> 
      I have been working with GCSP & EPICS at ASU to solve world problems and help make the world<br>
      a better place to live it mind sound cliche, but that is my main aim being a Computer Science student.<br> 
      I chose Computer Science because it is one of the majors that has the most influence in todays date<br>
      and also coding has been my passion since i was 14 years old<br>

    <h2> Experience </h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Office Desk Assistant</h3></li>
      <p>&bull; Handled the paperwork and documents concerned with MS-Office.<br>
         &bull; The workplace gave me great practical knowledge on data entry communication and helped gaining confidence.<br>
         &bull; Managed zoom meetings and scheduled them as per company requirements.<br>
      </p>
      <li><h3>Game Developer</h3></li>
      <p>&bull; Developed a prototype application along with three other teammates which contained 4 games.<br>
         &bull; Each teammate made and added a game to the app, and kept the game theme same as the app.<br>
         &bull; I made a brick breaker using p5.js and some java script knowledge.<br>
         &bull; The game allowed the user to access a bar/tile at the bottom of the screen using left-right arrow keys to break as<br>
                many possible bricks in 2 minutes with a ball which kept bouncing around the screen.<br>
         &bull; Didn’t add the bottom co-ordinates of the screen, so the game would be over if it touched anywhere on the bottom<br>
                except the bar/tile
     </p>
